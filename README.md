Describe your game *
Our game is modeled after "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes," a popular bomb defusal game aimed at teenagers around the world. However, since our game is much simpler and only involves one player, our game will be targeted towards tweens who do not have many friends. The player will be tasked with ensuring that a bomb will not explode by completing multiple mini games.
The mini games will be modeled around classics, such as Pong and Flappy Bird. The mini games will be of varying difficulty and will be coded by different members of the team. If the player completes all puzzles, a celebration scene will appear. However, if the player fails any of the mini games, the bomb will explode and he/she will have to restart the game. 

What makes this game an appropriate challenge for your group? *
-The code will include a multitude of aspects that we learned in class, such as Object Oriented Programming and functions.
-The game uses many graphics, which provides a new aspect of programming that we will need to focus on.
-We will be forced to think outside the box to create innovative mini games
-It will be a challenge to piece together the different mini games and puzzles

At this stage in our programming journey, we have reached a fork in the road and will be taking the path not taken. We are extremely excited for this project and fully prepared for the challenges that may lay ahead.
